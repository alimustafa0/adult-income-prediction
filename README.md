# Adult Income Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict adult income levels using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains various demographic and socioeconomic attributes of individuals, and the task is to classify whether an individual earns above or below $50,000 annually.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Handle missing values and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize the distributions and relationships of features.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Implement machine learning models, focusing on Random Forest Classifier.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using various metrics.
5. **Predicting Income**:
   - Deploy the trained model to predict income levels for new data instances.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib

## Usage
